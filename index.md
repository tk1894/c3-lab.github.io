# C3 Lab (Culture‑Centered Computing for Care)


C3 Lab focuses on research at the intersection of **human‑computer interaction, engaging systems, and digital health**—with an emphasis on **culture‑centered design** and community partnership.


We build and study technologies that support **care**, including:


- Culturally grounded digital health interventions (e.g., hypertension self‑management)
- Playful, game‑based and telehealth experiences that sustain engagement
- Community‑engaged methods for responsible, equitable computing


---


## Research Mission


We co‑create computing systems and interventions that reflect the **values, practices, and lived realities** of the communities they serve. Our work blends **participatory design**, **research‑through‑design**, and **rigorous evaluation** to help technologies become more trustworthy, usable, and effective in real care contexts.


**Themes:** culture‑centered design • engaging health technology • explainability AI • community‑engaged computing • care infrastructures

## Research Methods


C3 Lab uses mixed methods across design and evaluation, including:


- Community‑based participatory research (CBPR)
- Research‑through‑Design (RtD) and iterative prototyping
- Diary studies, interviews, and ethnographic fieldwork
- Usability + accessibility evaluation
- Quantitative analysis of engagement and outcomes
